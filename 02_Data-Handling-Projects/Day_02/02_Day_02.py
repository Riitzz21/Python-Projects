"""
Challenge : Student Marks Analyzer

Create a python program that allows a user to input student
names along with their marks and then calculates useful 
statistics.

Your program should :
1. Let the user input multiple students with their marks (name + integer score).
2. After input is complete, display :
   - Average Marks
   - Highest marks and student(s) who scored it.
   - Lowest marks and student(s) who scored it.
   - Total number of students.

Bonus :
- Allow the user to enter all data first, then view the report 
- Format output clearly in a report-style layout.
- Prevent duplicate student names
